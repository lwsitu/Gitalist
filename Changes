    - Support being able to pass a list of repositories to view via
      configuration, rather than having a static directory.
    - Installation and configuration documentation has been enhanced.
    - Project has been renamed Repository to correspond with normal git
      terminology.
    - Repos has been refactored into a CollectionOfRepositories role
      and two differnet concrete implementations (the Catalyst model
      chooses which type to build based on the config).
    - Remove all tabs and fix no tabs test (Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker)
    - Decode getpwuid values correctly (Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker)
    - Generate correct provides information in META.yml so that search.cpan
      indexes the classes contained in Gitalist correctly.

   - Add documentation about how to configure a Gitalist instance.
   - Fix so that invalid repository directory will be detected at application
     startup and a helpful error message will be displayed.
   - Add --repos_dir command line parameter to all of the scripts which can
     be used to force the repository directory, overriding config and
     environment.
   - Add GITALIST_REPOS_DIR environment variable which will determine the
     repository path (overriding normal config) if set.
   - Change so that no default repos path is in the config when installed from
     CPAN (when checked out of git, behavior of browsing AppDir/../ is
     maintained).
   - Do not allow directory traversal via the p param.
